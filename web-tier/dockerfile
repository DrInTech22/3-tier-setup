# Stage 1: Build React app with compatible Node version
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies first (better caching)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install 

# Copy source and build
COPY . .

RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve with NGINX (Lightweight production server)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built assets from builder stage to NGINX default directory
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# NGINX already exposes port 80 by default in its base image
EXPOSE 80

# NGINX runs automatically when container starts (no need for explicit CMD)
